# To-Do List

## What does this do?

- This program allows a user to input some text to add to a to-do list
- Once an item is added to the list it gives the user the option of either marking it complete (changing colour to green) or removing it from the list (it just changes its display to none)
- An empty string cannot be added to the list
- To add an item to the list the user presses return
